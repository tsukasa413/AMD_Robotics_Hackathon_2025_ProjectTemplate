## Code submission

This is the directory tree of this repo, you need to fill in the `mission` directory with your submission details.

```terminal
AMD_Robotics_Hackathon_2025_ProjectTemplate-main/
├── README.md
└── mission
    ├── code
    │   └── <code and script>
    └── wandb
        └── <latest run directory copied from wandb of your training job>
```


The `latest-run` is generated by wandb for your training job. Please copy it into the wandb sub directory of you Hackathon Repo.

The whole dir of `latest-run` will look like below:

```terminal
$ tree outputs/train/smolvla_so101_2cube_30k_steps/wandb/
outputs/train/smolvla_so101_2cube_30k_steps/wandb/

**NOTES**

1. The `latest-run` is the soft link, please make sure to copy the real target directory it linked with all sub dirs and files.
2. Only provide (upload) the wandb of your last success pre-trained model for the Mission.
